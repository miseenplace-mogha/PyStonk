# PlotPrice
tracking stock prices to learn python modules

The StockTicker.py script installs bs4 and requests libs and retrieves the latest stock price from a list of Symbols from Google Finance

The PlotPrice.py script uses bs4, requests, and matplotlib to create a plot of a stock's price movement over time
  *this script needs improvement for several features, and will hopefully be updates with more functionality soon
 
 Ideas for new scripts:
 \n Get historical stock price data
 \n Get other data from stock quote: volume, level2 data
 \n Print stock ladder w/ Greeks
